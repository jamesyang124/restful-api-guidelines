== {SHOULD} Use a Common Money Object

Use the following common money structure:

[source,yaml]
----
Money:
  type: object
  properties:
    amount:
      type: number
      description: Amount expressed as a decimal number of major currency units
      format: decimal
      example: 99.95
    currency:
      type: string
      description: 3 letter currency code as defined by ISO-4217
      format: iso-4217
      example: EUR
  required:
    - amount
    - currency
----

The decimal values for "amount" describe unit and subunit of the
currency in a single value, where the digits before the decimal point
are for the major unit and the digits after the decimal point are for
the minor unit. Note that some business cases (e.g. transactions in
Bitcoin) call for a higher precision, so applications must be prepared
to accept values with unlimited precision, unless explicitly stated
otherwise in the API specification. Examples for correct representations
(in EUR):

* `42.20` or `42.2` = 42 Euros, 20 Cent
* `0.23` = 23 Cent
* `42.0` or `42` = 42 Euros
* `1024.42` = 1024 Euros, 42 Cent
* `1024.4225` = 1024 Euros, 42.25 Cent

Make sure that you don’t convert the “amount” field to `float` /
`double` types when implementing this interface in a specific language
or when doing calculations. Otherwise, you might lose precision.
Instead, use exact formats like Java’s
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html[`BigDecimal`].
See http://stackoverflow.com/a/3730040/342852[Stack Overflow] for more
info.

Some JSON parsers (NodeJS’s, for example) convert numbers to floats by
default. After discussing the
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wTj-2w39f69XZGwRDrosNc1yWPwQpGgEs_DCt5ODaQ[pros
and cons (internal link)], we’ve decided on "decimal" as our amount format. It
is not a standard OpenAPI format, but should help us to avoid parsing numbers
as float / doubles.

[#174]
== {MUST} Use common field names and semantics

There exist a variety of field types that are required in multiple
places. To achieve consistency across all API implementations, you must
use common field names and semantics whenever applicable.

[[generic-fields]]
=== Generic Fields

There are some data fields that come up again and again in API data:

* `id`: the identity of the object. If used, IDs must opaque strings and
not numbers. IDs are unique within some documented context, are stable
and don't change for a given object once assigned, and are never
recycled cross entities.
* `xyz_id`: an attribute within one object holding the identifier of
another object must use a name that corresponds to the type of the
referenced object or the relationship to the referenced object followed
by `_id` (e.g. `customer_id` not `customer_number`; `parent_node_id` for
the reference to a parent node from a child node, even if both have the
type `Node`)
* `created`: when the object was created. If used, this must be a
`date-time` construct.
* `modified`: when the object was updated. If used, this must be a
`date-time` construct.
* `type`: the kind of thing this object is. If used, the type of this
field should be a string. Types allow runtime information on the entity
provided that otherwise requires examining the Open API file.

Example JSON schema:

[source,json]
----
tree_node:
  type: object
  properties: 
    id:
      description: the identifier of this node
      type: string
    created:
      description: when got this node created
      type: string
      format: 'date-time'
    modified:
      description: when got this node last updated
      type: string
      format: 'date-time'
    type:
      type: string
      enum: [ 'LEAF', 'NODE' ]
    parent_node_id:
      description: the identifier of the parent node of this node
      type: string
  example:
    id: '123435'
    created: '2017-04-12T23:20:50.52Z'
    modified: '2017-04-12T23:20:50.52Z'
    type: 'LEAF'
    parent_node_id: '534321'
----

These properties are not always strictly necessary, but making them
idiomatic allows API client developers to build up a common
understanding of Zalando's resources. There is very little utility for
API consumers in having different names or value types for these fields
across APIs.

[[address-fields]]
=== Address Fields

Address structures play a role in different functional and use-case
contexts, including country variances. All attributes that relate to
address information should follow the naming and semantics defined
below.

[source,yaml]
----
addressee:
  description: a (natural or legal) person that gets addressed
  type: object
  required:
    - first_name
    - last_name
    - street
    - city
    - zip
    - country_code
  properties:
    salutation:
      description: |
        a salutation and/or title used for personal contacts to some
        addressee; not to be confused with the gender information!
      type: string
      example: Mr
    first_name:
      description: |
        given name(s) or first name(s) of a person; may also include the
        middle names.
      type: string
      example: Hans Dieter
    last_name:
      description: |
        family name(s) or surname(s) of a person
      type: string
      example: Mustermann
    business_name:
      description: |
        company name of the business organization. Used when a business is
        the actual addressee; for personal shipments to office addresses, use
        `care_of` instead.
      type: string
      example: Consulting Services GmbH
  required:
    - first_name
    - last_name

address:
  description:
    an address of a location/destination
  type: object
  properties:
    care_of:
      description: |
        (aka c/o) the person that resides at the address, if different from
        addressee. E.g. used when sending a personal parcel to the
        office /someone else's home where the addressee resides temporarily
      type: string
      example: Consulting Services GmbH
    street:
      description: |
        the full street address including house number and street name
      type: string
      example: Schönhauser Allee 103
    additional:
      description: |
        further details like building name, suite, apartment number, etc.
      type: string
      example: 2. Hinterhof rechts
    city:
      description: |
        name of the city / locality
      type: string
      example: Berlin
    zip:
      description: |
        zip code or postal code
      type: string
      example: 14265
    country_code:
      description: |
        the country code according to
        [iso-3166-1-alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
      type: string
      example: DE
  required:
    - street
    - city
    - zip
    - country_code
----

Grouping and cardinality of fields in specific data types may vary based
on the specific use case (e.g. combining addressee and address fields
into a single type when modeling an address label vs distinct addressee
and address types when modeling users and their addresses).

[#175]
== {MUST} Follow Hypertext Control Conventions

APIs that provide hypertext controls (links) to interconnect API
resources must follow the conventions for naming and modeling of
hypertext controls as defined in section <<hypermedia>>.

[#176]
== {MUST} Use Problem JSON

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807[RFC 7807] defines the media type
`application/problem+json`. Operations should return that (together with
a suitable status code) when any problem occurred during processing and
you can give more details than the status code itself can supply,
whether it be caused by the client or the server (i.e. both for 4xx or
5xx errors).

A previous version of this guideline (before the publication of that RFC
and the registration of the media type) told to return
`application/x.problem+json` in these cases (with the same contents).
Servers for APIs defined before this change should pay attention to the
`Accept` header sent by the client and set the `Content-Type` header of
the problem response correspondingly. Clients of such APIs should accept
both media types.

APIs may define custom problems types with extension properties,
according to their specific needs.

The Open API schema definition can be found
https://zalando.github.io/problem/schema.yaml[on github]. You can
reference it by using:

[source,yaml]

[#177]
== {MUST} Do not expose Stack Traces

Stack traces contain implementation details that are not part of an API,
and on which clients should never rely. Moreover, stack traces can leak
sensitive information that partners and third parties are not allowed to
receive and may disclose insights about vulnerabilities to attackers.
